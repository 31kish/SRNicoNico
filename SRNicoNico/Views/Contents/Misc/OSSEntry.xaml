                                                "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<LineBreak />
                                            other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<LineBreak />
                                            by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<LineBreak />
                                            Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<LineBreak />
                                            of using an interface provided by the Library.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<LineBreak />
                                            Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<LineBreak />
                                            with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<LineBreak />
                                            Version".<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<LineBreak />
                                            Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<LineBreak />
                                            for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<LineBreak />
                                            based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<LineBreak />
                                            object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<LineBreak />
                                            and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<LineBreak />
                                            Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<LineBreak />
                                            without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                2. Conveying Modified Versions.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<LineBreak />
                                            facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<LineBreak />
                                            that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<LineBreak />
                                            facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<LineBreak />
                                            version:<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<LineBreak />
                                                ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<LineBreak />
                                                function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<LineBreak />
                                                whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<LineBreak />
                                                this License applicable to that copy.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<LineBreak />
                                            a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<LineBreak />
                                            code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<LineBreak />
                                            material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<LineBreak />
                                            layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<LineBreak />
                                            (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<LineBreak />
                                                Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<LineBreak />
                                                covered by this License.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<LineBreak />
                                                document.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                4. Combined Works.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<LineBreak />
                                            taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<LineBreak />
                                            portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<LineBreak />
                                            engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<LineBreak />

                                                a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<LineBreak />
                                                the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<LineBreak />
                                                covered by this License.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<LineBreak />
                                                document.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<LineBreak />
                                                execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<LineBreak />
                                                these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<LineBreak />
                                                copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                d) Do one of the following:<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                    0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<LineBreak />
                                                    License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<LineBreak />
                                                    suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<LineBreak />
                                                    recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<LineBreak />
                                                    the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<LineBreak />
                                                    manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<LineBreak />
                                                    Corresponding Source.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                    1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<LineBreak />
                                                    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<LineBreak />

                                                    system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<LineBreak />
                                                    of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<LineBreak />

                                                be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<LineBreak />
                                                GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<LineBreak />
                                                necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<LineBreak />
                                                Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<LineBreak />
                                                Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<LineBreak />

                                                You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<LineBreak />
                                            Library side by side in a single library together with other library<LineBreak />
                                            facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<LineBreak />
                                            License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<LineBreak />
                                            choice, if you do both of the following:<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<LineBreak />
                                                on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<LineBreak />
                                                conveyed under the terms of this License.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<LineBreak />

                                                The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<LineBreak />
                                            of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<LineBreak />
                                            versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<LineBreak />
                                            differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

                                                Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<LineBreak />

                                            published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<LineBreak />
                                            received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<LineBreak />
                                            General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<LineBreak />
